= Jenkins Declarative Parser

This repository contains an grammar and parser for the link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#declarative-pipeline-fundamentals[Jenkins Declarative Pipeline] syntax. It's for educational and testing purposes :)


== CLI

This repository provides the `jdp` command line utility which can be used for syntax
checking a declarative `Jenkinsfile`:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ jdp check data/valid/complex-deployment/Jenkinsfile
Checking: data/valid/complex-deployment/Jenkinsfile
Looks valid! Great work!
----

== Caveats

This parser is **not** a Groovy syntax parser, and as such any advanced or wacky
groovy that is littered around a `Jenkinsfile` should largely be ignored. This
includes the `script` step which is basically checked to make sure that there is
a `script { }` block, but anything within it is explicitly ignored.


== Development

Development of `jdp` is all driven through the use of `cargo`, e.g. `cargo test`.

It's relatively straightforward to use a local test Jenkins environment to validate
the `Jenkinsfile` located in `data/`. There is a major caveat in that many files
will fail to validate if certain plugins are not installed on the Jenkins.

Once a local Jenkins is created, be sure to set a fixed sshd port in the
`/configureSecurity` view (e.g. `2022`).
